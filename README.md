WORK SYNOPSIS:

A file transfer system is crafted mimicking a simple FTP service with all its basic
amenities, along with the steganographic techniques to visualise the idea of secure
transmission of files. The system is designed using TCP Socket programming involving
client-server counterparts in MATLAB. Embedding and Extraction algorithms of files
together make up the steganographic implementation for secure file transmission.
